# Sand Castle Game - Design Document

> **📝 Living Document**: This design specification is actively being developed and refined. As we implement features and gather insights during development, we'll expand this document to cover additional use cases, edge cases, and technical considerations that emerge during the building process.

## 🏰 Game Overview

**Sand Castle** is a mobile-first web game where players build a castle by precisely dropping sand castle parts. The game combines timing, precision, and physics for an engaging experience suitable for kids.

### 🎯 Target Audience & User Personas
- **Primary**: Kids ages 6-12 (with parent supervision for younger ones)
- **Secondary**: Family casual gamers, parents playing with kids
- **Accessibility**: Touch-first interface, simple mechanics, immediate visual feedback

### 🏆 Definition of Success (MVP)
- **Core Experience**: Player can complete first 5 levels with clear progression
- **Technical**: Runs smoothly on mid-range mobile devices (iPhone 12/Android equivalent, 60fps target)
- **Engagement**: Average session >3 minutes, 60%+ level completion rate
- **Stability**: Physics feel predictable and consistent, <10% player reports of "unfair" failures

### 🚧 Key Constraints & Assumptions
- **Budget**: Zero initial budget (free tools/hosting only)
- **Platform**: Web-first, PWA-ready, no app store requirements
- **Content**: Start with 5 MVP levels, expand based on >60% completion rate and user feedback

### 🎨 Development Philosophy: "Vibe Coding"
- **Iterative Development**: Implement MVP features first, then enhance based on playtesting feedback
- **Sustainable Progress**: Complete each development phase milestone before moving to next
- **Feature Validation**: New features only added after core mechanics feel satisfying to play
- **Quality over Quantity**: Prioritize polishing existing features over adding new ones
- **Developer-Player Feedback Loop**: If developers don't enjoy using a feature, redesign it

## 🎮 Core Game Mechanics

### 1. Castle Part Movement
- **Top Movement**: Castle parts move horizontally left-right at the top of the screen
- **Speed Variation**: Movement speed increases with level progression
- **Part Types**: Different castle components (base blocks, towers, walls, decorative elements)
- **Visual Feedback**: Parts cast a simple shadow directly below showing landing position (no physics prediction required)

### 2. Drop Mechanism
- **Input**: Single tap/click to release the part
- **Physics**: Gravity-based falling (9.8 units/second²) with 5% air resistance for visual appeal
- **Visual**: Smooth animation with particle effects (sand dust) on impact

### 3. Success Detection (Stability Physics - Chosen Approach)

Using **Matter.js physics engine** for realistic stability detection:

#### Primary: Physics-Based Stability
- **Perfect Stability**: Part settles with minimal movement (100 points)
- **Good Stability**: Slight wobble but settles quickly (75 points) 
- **Poor Stability**: Excessive wobbling, near collapse (25 points)
- **Collapse**: Castle parts fall or tip over (0 points, life lost)

#### Visual Feedback System
- **Green Glow**: Stable parts (velocity < 0.1)
- **Yellow Glow**: Slightly unstable (velocity 0.1-0.5)
- **Red Glow + Wobble**: Unstable parts (velocity > 0.5)
- **Crack Effects**: Parts about to fail

#### Physics Implementation
```typescript
// Type definitions for our game objects
interface CastlePartData {
  id: string;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  velocity: { x: number; y: number };
  isStable: boolean;
}

interface StabilityResult {
  stable: boolean;
  unstableParts: CastlePartData[];
  stabilityScore: number;
}

// Stability check using Matter.js
function checkStability(castleParts: CastlePartData[]): StabilityResult {
  const unstableParts = castleParts.filter(part => 
    Math.abs(part.velocity.x) > 0.1 || Math.abs(part.velocity.y) > 0.1
  );
  
  return {
    stable: unstableParts.length === 0,
    unstableParts,
    stabilityScore: (castleParts.length - unstableParts.length) / castleParts.length
  };
}

// Realistic sand physics properties
const sandPartProperties: Matter.IBodyDefinition = {
  density: 0.8,
  friction: 0.3,
  frictionStatic: 0.8,
  restitution: 0.1 // Low bounce for sand
};
```

### 4. Level Progression (MVP: 5 Levels)
- **Level 1**: Tutorial level - 2 parts, simple stack
- **Level 2**: Basic foundation - 3 parts, wider base
- **Level 3**: Add height - 4 parts, 2-story structure  
- **Level 4**: Tower challenge - 5 parts, include narrow tower piece
- **Level 5**: Complete castle - 6 parts, complex shape with decorative element
- **Post-MVP**: Moving targets, multiple drop points, special parts

### 5. Losing Mechanisms
- **Limited Attempts**: 3 failed drops per level (MVP feature)
- **Stability System**: Castle collapses if too unstable (primary loss condition)
- **Time Pressure**: Optional timer for advanced levels (post-MVP)
- **Foundation Failure**: Too many poor placements cause structural collapse

## 🎨 Visual Design (Kids-Oriented)

### Art Style
- **Color Palette**: Primary sand colors (#F4D03F, #E67E22, #D2691E), accent blue (#3498DB), white (#FFFFFF)
- **Border Radius**: 8px minimum for all interactive elements, 4px for decorative elements
- **Cartoon Style**: Flat design with subtle gradients, no photorealistic textures
- **UI Element Sizes**: Minimum 44px touch targets (iOS guidelines), 16px+ font sizes

### Background Options
1. **Real Beach Photo**: Blurred/stylized real beach imagery
2. **Vector Beach Scene**: Simplified cartoon beach with waves, clouds, sun
3. **Canvas Animation**: Animated waves, moving clouds, seagulls

### UI Elements
- **Score Display**: Large, colorful numbers
- **Progress Bar**: Visual castle completion indicator
- **Lives/Attempts**: Heart icons or sand bucket indicators
- **Level Indicator**: Beach flag or sandcastle size comparison

## 🔊 Audio Design

### Sound Effects
- **Part Drop**: 0.2s whoosh sound, decreasing pitch (800Hz to 400Hz)
- **Successful Placement**: 0.1s click sound, 1000Hz tone
- **Perfect Placement**: 0.5s ascending chime (C-E-G major chord)
- **Miss/Failure**: 0.3s soft thud, 200Hz low tone (volume <50% of other sounds)
- **Level Complete**: 2s celebratory melody in C major
- **Game Over**: 1s gentle upward melody encouraging retry

### Background Music
- **Beach Theme**: 120 BPM instrumental track with ocean wave samples, major key (C or G major)
- **Volume Control**: Persistent mute button in top-right corner, 0-100% volume slider in settings
- **Adaptive**: Increase tempo by 10 BPM and add percussion layers for levels 3-5

- **File Size**: Individual images <50KB, audio files <100KB, total assets <1.5MB

## 🎯 Strategic Mitigation Approach

### Core Strategy: Start Simple, Validate Early
- **MVP First**: Get basic dropping mechanic working and test with real kids
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add complexity only after validating core fun factor
- **Performance Budget**: Set strict limits and test on low-end devices from day one
- **Graceful Degradation**: Game works even when advanced features fail

### Validation Gates
- **Developer Satisfaction**: If feature takes >2 days to implement or feels frustrating, simplify approach
- **Target User Testing**: Test with 3-5 kids (ages 6-12) at each milestone
- **Device Performance**: Maintain 60fps on iPhone 12 / Samsung Galaxy A52 as baseline
- **Resource Check**: Each milestone should complete within current available development time
