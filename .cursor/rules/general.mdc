**Build Validation**: Run `npm run build` from the project root to check for syntax errors, validation issues, and dependency problems

**Development**: Do not use `npm run dev` to run the project, as it is already running.

**Debugging**: When debugging, use the console.log() function to print messages to the console. User will be able to see the messages and provide feedback.

**Code Duplication Prevention**: 
- **HIGH PRIORITY**: Always use existing helper functions from `src/utils/` instead of duplicating code
- **TextUtils**: Use `createResponsiveText()`, `createResponsiveTitle()`, `createCenteredResponsiveText()` for all text creation
- **ButtonUtils**: Use `createKidFriendlyButton()` for all button creation
- **Predefined Configs**: Use `TEXT_CONFIGS` and `BUTTON_CONFIGS` for consistent styling
- **DRY Principle**: If you find yourself writing similar code in multiple places, create a helper function
- **Refactor Existing Code**: When modifying scenes, replace direct text/button creation with helper functions
**Development**: Do not use `npm run dev` to run the project, as it is already running.
